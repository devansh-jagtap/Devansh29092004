# 👋 Hi, I’m Devansh Jagtap

I’m a **final-year Computer Science student and frontend-focused full-stack developer from India**, interested in building well-structured, real-world web applications.

I mainly work with **Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Node.js**, and I have experience shipping features for **live products**, not just demos. I enjoy working close to the UI layer—thinking about **component design, performance, and clean state management**—while also being comfortable wiring up backends with **APIs, authentication, and databases**.

My recent work has involved building **AI-powered features** such as resume analysis, content generation, and smart dashboards, with a focus on **integrating AI into real products** instead of isolated experiments.

I’ve participated in and **won multiple hackathons** (including **Better Hack** and **Urja 4.0**), which pushed me to build complete solutions end-to-end under tight deadlines and collaborate effectively in small teams.

Most of what I build lives at the intersection of:

- Clean frontend architecture  
- Practical full-stack systems  
- Thoughtful user experience  

Always learning, always building.
